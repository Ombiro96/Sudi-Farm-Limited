            <p>The Sudi-Farm Service Agency's (SFSA) electronic Loan Deficiency Payment Service (eLDP) is an Internet-based service allowing producers to request LDPs online and, in most cases, receive approval and payment by direct deposit within 72 hours. eLDPs are available to eligible producers in all 47 Counties and are offered as an additional option to producers requesting an LDP. LDP benefits are still available at the local FSA county office.
                 However, eLDP services provide greater flexibility to producers who conduct business online and want to avoid travel time to and from the local FSA office.</p>
