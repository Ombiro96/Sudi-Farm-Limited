            <h1>We Offer online Services to our customers</h1>
            <h2>What are eLDP's?</h2>
            <p>The Sudi-Farm Service Agency's (SFSA) electronic Loan Deficiency Payment Service (eLDP) is an
                Internet-based service allowing producers to request LDPs online and, in most cases, receive approval
                and payment by direct deposit within 72 hours. eLDPs are available to eligible producers in all 47
                Counties and are offered as an additional option to producers requesting an LDP. LDP benefits are still
                available at the local FSA county office.
                However, eLDP services provide greater flexibility to producers who conduct business online and want to
                avoid travel time to and from the local FSA office.</p>

                How Do I Access the eLDP Service?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Access to the eLDP service is available to all Sudi Farm customers. In order to insure personal
                identity, you must first register for a Sudi -Farm eAuthentication Level 2 Account. This process is easy
                and starts online by creating a user ID and password and confirming your email.
                Once you have your eAuthentication account, you can click on the 'Access eLDP Service' link below and
                enter your user ID and password on the Sudi-Farm login screen.

                Access eLDP Service
            </h1>
            <p>
                Sudi Farm provides eLDP services in a secure online environment that protects participants' privacy
                through stringent security measures.
                â€¢ All participating customers will have an eLDP Customer Profile set up through a software application
                that validates their farming and crop information.

                Sudi-Farm eLDP customers can use a personal computer to submit an LDP application. After the eLDP is
                approved by Sudi Farm, the payment is automatically routed by electronic funds transfer to the
                customer's bank account.
                The eLDP process is available 24/7, except during routine backup and maintenance periods. The applicable
                LDP Rate is based upon the rate in effect on the application date for the location of the stored
                commodity.
