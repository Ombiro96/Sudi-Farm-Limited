            <h1>What are eLDP's?</h1>
            <p>The Sudi-Farm Service Agency's (SFSA) electronic Loan Deficiency Payment Service (eLDP) is an Internet-based service allowing producers to request LDPs online and, in most cases, receive approval and payment by direct deposit within 72 hours. eLDPs are available to eligible producers in all 47 Counties and are offered as an additional option to producers requesting an LDP. LDP benefits are still available at the local FSA county office.
                 However, eLDP services provide greater flexibility to producers who conduct business online and want to avoid travel time to and from the local FSA office.</p>

                Access eLDP Service
            </h1>
            <p>
                Sudi Farm provides eLDP services in a secure online environment that protects participants' privacy through stringent security measures.
â€¢	All participating customers will have an eLDP Customer Profile set up through a software application that validates their farming and crop information.

Sudi-Farm eLDP customers can use a personal computer to submit an LDP application. After the eLDP is approved by Sudi Farm, the payment is automatically routed by electronic funds transfer to the customer's bank account.
The eLDP process is available 24/7, except during routine backup and maintenance periods. The applicable LDP Rate is based upon the rate in effect on the application date for the location of the stored commodity.
